<p>Dear potential host, </p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in providing accommodation for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. </p>
<p>First, the form below will save your data in a secure, encrypted database that is hosted in Germany. It is used by a group of private volunteers of https://www.accommodation-for-refugees.com/, and driven by open-source code. </p>

<p>Second, volunteers at LAF <a href="https://www.berlin.de/laf/">(Landesamt für Flüchtlingsangelegenheiten)</a> will review your form information to determine if your offer matches with refugees in need who arrive on-site. If there are any changes on your side, please update the details in your host profile.</p>

<p>Finally, LAF volunteers will contact you by phone when there is a match. You are then expected to come to the LAF to meet your new guests. This may happen very quickly.</p>
