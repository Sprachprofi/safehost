        It is true that the whole housing topic is very confusing. In general, one should distinguish between sites that give data access to:
    <ol type="i" class="">
    <li>official authorities </li>
    <li>volunteers cooperating with official authorities </li>
    <li>volunteers </li>
    <li>refugees directly </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="">They also differ according to the level of ID verification and safety check that is done, and data protection standards adhered to. Have a look at the below table, in which safety is arguably the higher the further away from the lower-right corner. We cannot guarantee accuracy nor accept liability for decisions based on this table:</p>

 <p class="mt-3">Any official authority will require high safety standards when connecting  refugees with hosts. On the other hand, informal sites or media can often be very quick, but come with safety risks, which official authorities will never take. This site aims to fill a gap which was previously filled by online sheet forms, for which it is harder to verify who is behind them.

        Yes, this is unfortunately a tricky topic. It would be most logical if they searched for and found accommodation in a part of Germany or Europe where there is still long-term housing available. However, there are currently very few platforms which fulfil security requirements at least as good as this site and work quickly for such cases, which is a clear gap. While in principle, your guests could show up again on-site where data from this homepage is used, Berlin beds are also needed for new arrivals. Hence it would be great if you can monitor official advice for such cases and/or make sure they are searching via the most secure channels among those listed in Table 1 above.
